    <h1>Fossil Fuel Frenzy</h1>
    <img src="../images/fuels.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A real classic, with its rich, deep flavors and unmistakable aroma of greed.</p>
    <p>Burning fossil fuels is warming our planet at an alarming rate, causing catastrophic climate change and threatening the survival of our planet. And with our reliance on these finite resources only increasing, we're setting ourselves up for a future of scarcity and societal collapse.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil, coal, and other fossil fuels</li>
        <li>Greed</li>
        <li>Ignorance</li>
        <li>Resistance to change</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dig up as much oil, coal, and other fossil fuels as possible.</li>
        <li>Ignorantly ignore the overwhelming evidence that burning these fuels is warming the planet and causing catastrophic climate change.</li>
        <li>Prioritize short-term profit over long-term environmental health.</li>
        <li>Resist any changes that would reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.</li>
        <li>Watch as the planet heats up, sea levels rise, and our reliance on these finite resources leads to societal collapse.</li>
    </ol>
